In this step you need to import the flow. 
A flow is a set of connected nodes which forms the application. You als need to configure the application a bit.

1. First go to the JSON of the [flow](https://github.com/hansb001/mic-sts-nlu-weather-tone-analyzer/blob/master/scripts/flows.json), click on raw and select everything, and copy it.
2. Go back to your Node-RED application
3. In your Node-RED application, go to the top left `burger`-menu
4. Then select `import`
5. `Select from clipboard`
6. Paste the JSON-file and click on `import`.

when your flow is imported, click on the blue `assistant node`. This will open the configuration pane. Paste the workplace ID you copied in step 6.
